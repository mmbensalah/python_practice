# 1. Assume you have a list of numbers nums = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
# a.Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line, like this:
# b.Write a second loop that prints each number and its square on a new line, precisely like this:
nums = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]

for i in nums:
    print(i)
    
for i in nums:
    print(i, i**2)
